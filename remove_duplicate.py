# Remove Duplicat from Sorted Array
#Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears 
#only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Since it is impossible to change the length of the array 
#in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k 
#elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you 
#leave beyond the first k elements.

#Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

print(range(4))
